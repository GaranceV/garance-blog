## Who I am ?

To get presentations out of the way, I am Garance, which is a very unusual French name.
I have never personally met any other, even if I know they exist. I live in sunny Barcelona, which I really love. I am discovering the city and learning Spanish, while working as a web developer in a service company. While this is often not considered the most fulfilling job (at least where I come from), I find a good balance there, and have many growing occasions.

My Twitter handle is [@GaranceVallat](http://twitter.com/garancevallat).

## What's this ?

This is the start of Garance's blog.
I'm a software engineer, and I feel sometimes Twitter is not enough. As a consequence, I want to have a space where I can write in more details, and come back to it when I look for something.

For now, this blog is a static website generated with [Gatsby](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby), and hosted in a [S3 bucket](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingBucket.html). I will certainly talk about this, in more details!

## What will this blog contain ?

I aim at sharing things I learn, things I am interested in. Trying my hand at new technologies as well, with the building of this blog.

I am Javascript focused, but is is quite circumstantial.

I will write about accessibility on the web, for which I feel strongly.
